INTODB
======

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Intodb.pl provides a mechanism for storing benchmark results, processing
them and generating graphs from the data. Data is stored in a SQLite
database and, currently, graphs are generated using the jgraph tool
([[http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/jgraph/jgraph.html]]).


USER GUIDE
----------

Type './intodb.pl man' or 'perldoc ./intodb.pl' to see the user guide
(it requires the 'perldoc' command). See the REQUIREMENTS section in
the user guide to see the required perl modules (you may download and
install them from CPAN [[http://www.cpan.org]]).


WARNING
-------

Intodb.pl was conceived as a fast tool to process and store data extracted
from benchmarks (usually in form of csv files) and to provide a flexible
mechanism to generate an approximate graphical representation of such
data. The statistical process to generate the graphical representations
may be inaccurate and cannot be used as a substitute of a proper statistical
analysis: use it at your own risk.
